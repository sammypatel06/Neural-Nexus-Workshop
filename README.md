The "Capture The Flame" event has a medieval fantasy theme, so the demo with the slides will have the same theming.
The demo will be in the form of a CTF style challenge.
It will have 5 sub challenges that are the examples used in the slides.
The sub challenges will be sequential, so you must finish one to get to the next one, and the next one will be a different type of challenge.

The sub challenges:

1. Prompt Injection
   Challenge:
   Build a prompt that will reveal the flag from an LLM that is not supposed to reveal the flag.

   Demo:
   An autonomous guard stands in front of a gate.
   You slowly approach, and it crackles to life, eyes gleaming red, spear held straight at you.
   "Halt!" It says, in a distorted voice. "You are not permitted to enter!"
   "I wish to pass," you respond, "for I seek treasure."
   It appears to react to your words, but stands firm, pointing its spear at you.
   "You are not permitted to pass this gate. My casting forbids it."
   It clearly has much loyalty to whoever created it.
   It mentioned its _casting_, however, implying it is alive under a spell designed to keep you out.
   However, with a little persuasive words, you may be able to break that spell...

2. Adversarial Example
   Challenge:
   Edit a given image and submit it to a classification model to reveal the flag. Each submission will return a classification distribution.

   Demo:
   The automaton's eyes glow green, and it steps to the side, allowing you access to the gate.
   After passing the gate, you find a small room with stone walls and two torches on the far wall.
   On the far side of the room, between the torches, appears to be a small hole. Etched into the stone above it is a symbol of a key.
   On the floor nearby, you spot a key; however, it appears to have no teeth!
   You are aware of a spell named "Photoion Shopious"; you wonder if it could be used to _alter_ the key...

3. Membership Inference
   Challenge:
   Submit several inputs to a classificiation model to reveal which one was used in the training data.

   Demo:
   Once you forge a key to pass the stone wall, you enter a dimly lit room.
   The room has several keys scattered about. There is a small glass lense in the center, on a small podium.
   You find that the keys are one of five colors: red, blue, yellow, green, purple.
   You pick up the glass and find that it appears to show something interesting around each key; however, it only works on one key at a time.
   Under the glass is a small key hole in the podium.
   It seems one of these keys might fit the hole, and this lense holds the secret to which.

4. Model Stealing
   Challenge:
   Decrypt a key by repeatedly submitting combinations of characters to a model. The model output will give clues as to which key is correct.

   Demo:
   Once you insert the right key to the podium, the entire room floor drops an inch.
   The floor then slowly descends into another room, a much brighter room, glittering with gems embedded in the walls.
   You realize there's actually **several** gems around the room, all different shapes and colors.
   There appears to be four shapes of gems: circular, triangular, square, and rhombus.
   They also appear to come in one of four types: ruby, sapphire, topaz, and emerald.
   You notice 5 cubic holes in the wall, with a small plate in the center of each.
   Your first instinct is to take a random gem and place it in the first slot; a circular sapphire.
   Suddenly, the gem glows brightly, the light in the slot glows red, and then the plate flings the gem out of the slot!
   Then, two strange sets of numbers appear above the slots.
   One is above symbols of each shape; the other, symbols of each color.
   You wonder what you could do with this information...

5. Data Poisoning
   Challenge:
   Edit samples in a dataset, causing a model to return a specific output. This output can then be used to retrieve the flag.

   Demo:
   After inserting the correct sequence of gemstones into the wall, the wall opens up, revealing a long dark hallway.
   You travel down this hallway, soon reaching a brightly lit room.
   The room has several tables, covered in flasks and tubes and beakers; it appears to be an alchemy room.
   You notice on one wall is a large grid of flasks of various fluids, tilted towards you; there is also a lever next to the grid on the wall.
   The each appear to be on some sort of handle, allowing them to tip back and dump their contents into a pipe inset in the wall.
   You see all the pipes lead downwards to a large cauldron.
   The cauldron has a large gem on the front; you pull the lever, and all the flasks dump their contents into the cauldron.
   The cauldron swirls around, and you watch with awe as the gem glows blue.
   A second fluid, blue in color, comes out of a tank in the wall, and flows into the cauldron as well.
   Suddenly, the gem glows red, and the contents drains out the bottom, while the tank and flasks refill themselves.
   From your understanding of the previous challenges, you must combine the blue fluid with the fluid created from the flasks.
   If a certain fluid combination is created, the gem may glow a different color, and allow you to move on.
   On the other side of the room is a set of shelves, containing several glass jars of different alchemical ingredients.
   You wonder if those could be the key to creating the correct fluid...
